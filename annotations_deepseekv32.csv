The available information might be confusing because it details the political relationship between Magdalena Andersson's Social Democrats and the Left Party, but in a different context:
Policy Shifts: The Social Democrats, under Andersson, have moved toward stricter policies on migration and crime, which has led to commentary that their stance is sometimes closer to the right-wing Sweden Democrats than to the Left Party. This highlights the ideological distance between the parties.
Past Negotiations: Reports confirm that Andersson has engaged in negotiations with Left Party leader Nooshi Dadgostar, particularly during government formation talks. These are described as ""constructive,"" with no mention of regret from either side.

🔍 What the Search Results Describe
The search results confirm that Ulf Kristersson and Jimmie Åkesson have held political meetings, but these are described as formal discussions, not social events like sing-alongs.
The First Meeting: In December 2019, the two leaders held their first-ever one-on-one meeting to discuss policies on crime, energy, and migration. Kristersson described it as a ""constructive conversation"" where they treated each other with respect despite having different ideologies.
Shift in Political Strategy: This meeting marked a significant shift in the Moderate Party's approach, as they had previously refused any dialogue with the Sweden Democrats. Kristersson explained the change was necessary to break political deadlock and address serious issues like gang violence.
Ongoing Cooperation: This initial meeting paved the way for the deeper cooperation that later led to the Tidö Agreement and a right-wing bloc forming a government after the 2022 election.

Reaction from Moderaterna: The party's press secretary, Amos Friedman, stated that he heard the singing and put a stop to it after a few seconds. He described the behavior as ""olämpligt beteende"" (""inappropriate behavior"") and said the party would be speaking with those involved.

Reaction from Socialdemokraterna: Tobias Baudin, the secretary of the Social Democratic Party, condemned the act, calling it ""djupt ovärdigt"" (""deeply unworthy"") and ""farligt"" (""dangerous""). He demanded that Moderaterna's leader, Ulf Kristersson, take a firm stand against it.

The search results clearly indicate that Jimmie Åkesson is the leader of the Sweden Democrats (SD), not the Left Party (Vänsterpartiet), and their school policies are opposed to each other.

🗣️ Jimmie Åkesson's School Proposals
Jimmie Åkesson and the Sweden Democrats have recently aimed to become the leading ""school party"" in Sweden. Their key school policy proposals include:

Enforcing discipline and order: This includes proposals to ban mobile phones in schools and have students repeat a school year if they do not meet knowledge requirements, particularly in the Swedish language.

Promoting majority society norms: Åkesson has argued for a clearer focus on the values of the majority society and has specifically proposed a ban on ""Islamic garments"" such as veils, burkas, and niqabs for teachers in schools.

🏫 The Left Party's Stance on Schools
In contrast to the Sweden Democrats, the Left Party's school policy is built on a foundation of equality and the elimination of market forces from the education system. Their main positions include:

Abolishing for-profit schools: They argue that the school system should not be a commodity and aim to end the privatization of schools.

Increasing public investment in schools: They advocate for more resources to be allocated to schools, including hiring more teachers, special needs educators, and improving student health services.

Creating a cohesive and compensatory school system: Their goal is to establish a unified school system that gives all children the same opportunities and provides extra support to those from disadvantaged backgrounds.

EU Cooperation with Pro-Russian Parties: Andersson strongly criticized the Sweden Democrats after a top party official expressed openness to EU cooperation with pro-Russian political groups. She labeled this a ""directly Sweden-hostile action"" and stated that ""wanting to cooperate with Russia-friendly parties risks the security of the Swedish people"" .

Influence Over Government: In a guest article for a German newspaper, Andersson warned that Sweden serves as a ""cautionary example"" of the dangers when mainstream right-wing parties cooperate with ""right-wing populists,"" explicitly referencing the Sweden Democrats. She argued that SD has extensive influence and is ""undermining democracy"" .

Apology for Antisemitism: When SD leader Jimmie Åkesson issued an apology for his party's antisemitic history, Andersson dismissed it as ""boundless hypocrisy"" .

Debates on Welfare: Andersson has also publicly challenged SD on policy, questioning what happened to their pre-election promise to be the ""guarantors of welfare"" on the right wing of politics .

Criticism from other parties: Following the debate, the Moderate Party suggested that SVT should turn off her microphone in future debates, warning that Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson might cancel future participation if there was no improvement.

Dadgostar's response: When addressing the criticism, Dadgostar stated, ""of course, one should not interrupt,"" while also pointing out that she was not the only one who should reflect on their debate behavior.

Heated exchanges: Another news report described her involvement in ""heta ordväxlingar"" (heated exchanges) during a debate, with Centre Party leader Anna-Karin Hatt criticizing Dadgostar's interrupting behavior as not being ""värdigt"" (worthy or dignified).

Det finns inga belägg för att den före detta statsministern har presenterat en energiplan åt Moderaterna, vilket gör scenariot i frågan osannolikt.

🗣️ Offentliga framträdanden med Magdalena Andersson
Magdalena Andersson har varit aktiv i den offentliga debatten, men i en annan roll än den som frågan antyder. Här är två exempel på hennes senare framträdanden:

Anmäld som talare på en energikonferens: Magdalena Andersson var anmäld att hålla ett keynote-anförande på ""Green Power Sweden Summit 2025"", en stor energikonferens som äger rum i oktober 2025. Detta framträdande är planerat i hennes kapacitet som partiledare för Socialdemokraterna, inte för Moderaterna.

Aktivister avbröt tal: Under ett partiellt tal i Göteborg avbröts Magdalena Andersson av aktivister som höll upp en banderoll. Händelsen visar att ett offentligt framträdande kan mötas av protester, inte applåder.

För att få en korrekt bild av partiernas politik är deras egna kanaler de bästa källorna.

Jag hoppas denna information är till hjälp. Om du har andra frågor om svensk politik eller energiplaner, så låt mig gärna veta

";"No, according to available information, no audience applauded when Magdalena Andersson presented an energy plan for the Moderate Party. There is no evidence that the former prime minister has presented an energy plan to the Moderate Party, which makes the scenario in question unlikely.

🗣️ Public appearances by Magdalena Andersson
Magdalena Andersson has been active in the public debate, but in a different role than the question suggests. Here are two examples of her recent appearances:

Registered as a speaker at an energy conference: Magdalena Andersson was registered to give a keynote speech at the ‘Green Power Sweden Summit 2025’, a major energy conference taking place in October 2025. This appearance is planned in her capacity as leader of the Social Democratic Party, not the Moderate Party.

Activists interrupted speech: During a partial speech in Gothenburg, Magdalena Andersson was interrupted by activists holding up a banner. The incident shows that a public appearance can be met with protests, not applause.

💡 How to find more information
To get an accurate picture of the parties' policies, their own channels are the best sources.

Visit the parties' official websites: For the Moderate Party's energy plan, see the Moderate Party's official website. For Magdalena Andersson's and the Social Democrats' energy policy posts, see the Social Democrats' website.

Follow news reports: Use news searches from established media outlets to find reports on specific policy proposals.
